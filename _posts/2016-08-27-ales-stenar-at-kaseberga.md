## Ales Stenar at Kåseberga

This ancient megalithic monument, believed to have been created from the Nordic Iron-age period (1400 yrs ago), consists of 59 large stones arranged into a the shape of a ship. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6af3220a-ee05-4d5b-b1f1-e3863e3c7e45.jpg)

This beautiful place is found above the beautiful little fishing village harbour of Kåseberga in Österlen, almost on the cliff edge, and commands expansive 360 degree 'huge sky' views over the Baltic Sea and the gorgeous local countryside.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/911f6f1a-73bb-46f5-80a1-93a0a0ad65bf.jpg)
