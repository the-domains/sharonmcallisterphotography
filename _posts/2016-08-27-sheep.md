## Sheep

In August 2016, I went for a walk with a Shepherdess and her two working collie dogs. It was fabulous to go on this 'sheepdog hike' in some of the most beautiful Österlen countryside, overlooking the sea, near Kåseberga.

It was a fantastic experience watching these dogs work, under the supervision and whistle instruction of their shepherdess owner. There was such synchronicity between them all and the dogs had clearly defined roles. they knew exactly what their job was. Amazing.

I took a few photographs while I was there, and this one turned out to be my absolute favourite. Somehow it seems to have a comical element to it and so every time I look at it, it makes me smile :) ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/62945df5-ccd6-40c7-89e5-b1d72308769e.jpg)
